Niew in 12.64

1. Fixed calculation of block-centre offset.

2. Added pure JavaScript support (use Emscripten to generate JS code).
   This uses IndexedDB browser storage and this is currently known to
   be compatible with Firefox (version 4 and higher), Chrome (version 11
   and higher and IE (version 10 and higher).

3. Added JS compilation symbol alongside IOS. Both imply ADVLIB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.63 version (since 12.54)

1. Fixed prompt_line being undefined if NO_READLINE is specified.

2. BROWSER mode no longer ignores BROWSER NONE in the config file.

3. The -C command like keyword can be used with the CGI mode with
   the result of output being plain text rather than HTML.

4. Added ADVLIB mode for platforms such as iOS, which insist on being
   in control of the main loop.

5. Added emscripten support for producing a pure Javascript version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.54

1. Bug fix. Command line parsing no longer aborts after some of
   the keywords.

2. Bug fix. UNDO or REDO can no longer leave the game expecting 
   a yes/no answer to a question asked just before the point
   to which the game has reverted.
     
------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.53

1. Bug fix. Game no longer crashes in the console mode in response to
   player hitting Ctrl-D when prompted for input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.52

1. Bug fix for MS Windows and DOS. The RESTORE command no longer causes 
   infinite loop if there are no saved games.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.51 (12.40 to 12.50 never released)

1. Glk support dropped. On all platforms the game executable
   uses browser display or runs in the console window.

2. Added TIMEOUT section to the config file.

3. Added COLOUR SURROUND to the config file.

4. When creating a config file, BROWSER section is now platform
   sensitive, differentiating Windows and non-Windows installs.

5. Readline is now linked by default, suppressed by -DNO_READLINE.

6. Acode directory is now by default .acode on non-Windows platforms.
   If this is not found, the acode one is used instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.39 (12.35 to 12.38 never released)

1. Re-wrote code for locating acode.inf.

2. Added macro platform definitions (LINUX, UNIX, MACOS, WINDOWS)
   replacing the PLATFORM macro.

3. Fixed some text formatting bugs.

4. Fixed STYLE 1 orphan handling.

5. Fixed STYLE 1 segfault in response to an unknown command word.

6. Finished version 12 CGI mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.34

1. Fixed logging mechanism so that the prompt line is written into the
   log too.

2. Finally got around to sorting out A-code 12 CGI mode.

3. In HTML modes (CGI or browser) prompt type is signalled by the first
   letter of the complete message, not by the last one.

4. Fixed handling of texts declared as fragments part-way through
   the text rather than in the text declaration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.33

1. The DEFAULT directive now differentiates between failure to
   find any target and a failure to find a unique tagret. These outcomes
   are signalled by AGR2 being set to 0 or AMBIGWORD respectively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.32.

1. Fixed the the debug mode DUMP command (implemented in show_data()).

2. Fixed display width definition in browser mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.31.

1. Fixed output formatting bug, which in some circumstances suppressed
   the command prompt.

2. Added "SHOW WIDTH <number>" directive to acode.conf. This specifies
   in pixels the width of the actual display area. Default value 700. 

3. Added "SURROUND <colour>" directive to acode.conf to specify the
   colour of the window outside the display area. Defaults to dark grey.

NB: the new directives will not show automatically in your acode.conf.
You can add them manually, or remove (or rename) the existing
acode.conf, which will result in a new one being created by the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.30.

1. Worked around the problem caused by a change in xdg-open.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.29.

1. Some changes to acdc (version 12.18) -- see the acdc README and NEWS
   files.

2. All A-code game executables now accept the -v keyword, which causes
   the display of the game version number, the version number of the
   acdc translator used to create the C sources, and the A-code kernel
   version.

3. Game's home is now acode/<gamename> which is, if required,
   automatically created in the player's home directory. This is where
   games will be saved and old saved games will be looked for. It is
   also where log files (if any) are created by default.

4. As a temporary measure in this version, on game startup other likely
   places are checked for containing older saved games, and any saved
   games fuond are copied into the game's home directory.

5. Games now have a persistent state, so that if a game is interrupted
   in some manner, rather than cleanly exited, it will automatically
   restart the next time at the same point. Use the -n invocation command
   line option to avoid restarting an interrupted game.

6. On Linux/Unix/MacOS, the default game mode is to use a local browser
   for its display. Use the -C command invocation line option to use
   old-fashioned, console display with readline command recall and editing.
   On windows only the "dumb" DOS prompt mode is available, unless the
   game is built to use the Glk library.
